Randomized Optimization Assignment Overview:

In this project, I compare performance, training iterations/wall clock time, and strengths/weaknesses of various Randomized Optimization Algorithms 
- Random Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm
- MIMIC

Project Requirements:
To run these notebooks you will need:
- Python3
- csv module: for importing and processing the datasets
- numpy: for data manipulation
- matplotlib: for data visualization
- Sci-Kit Learn: for implementing machine learning models 
- mlrose_hiive: package that contains randomized optimization algorithms and sample problems
- time: to measure wall clock time of each algorithm

How to run:
Project2.ipynb contains all required imports, code, and visualizations for this analysis. When open, you can select Cell => Run All to run the entire 
analysis for each dataset.
