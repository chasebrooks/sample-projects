Supervised Learning Assignment Overview:
In this project, we seek to compare performance, training process, hyperparameter tuning, 
and training times of various machine learning methods 
- Decision Tree
- Neural Network
- Boosting (AdaBoost)
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Project Requirements:
To run these notebooks you will need:
- Python3
- csv module: for importing and processing the datasets
- numpy: for data manipulation
- pandas: for data manipulation
- matplotlib: for data visualization
- Sci-Kit Learn: for implementing machine learning models

How to run:
Each dataset has it's own respective jupyter notebook with the appropriate module and data imports, 
model training, and visual generation. When open, you can select Cell => Run All to run the entire 
analysis for each dataset.
The notebooks are broken up into:
- Module imports
- Data import and transformation (as necessary)
- Model training and analysis (1 section for each model type)
- Model comparison (score and training time)
