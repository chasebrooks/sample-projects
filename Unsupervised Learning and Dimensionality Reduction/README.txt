Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Assignment Overview:
In this project, we seek to compare performance of various unsupervised clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction methods. We then apply these learnings to a labeled dataset to determine the power of dimensionality reduction and implementing clusters as feaures on neural networks. 

Project Requirements:
To run these notebooks you will need:
- Python3
- csv module: for importing and processing the datasets
- numpy: for data manipulation
- pandas: for data manipulation
- matplotlib: for data visualization
- Sci-Kit Learn: for implementing machine learning models

How to run:
Each dataset has it's own respective jupyter notebook with the appropriate module and data imports, 
model training, and visual generation. When open, you can select Cell => Run All to run the entire 
analysis for each dataset.
The notebooks are as follows:
- 1. Digits: Contains analysis of the digits dataset
- 2. Human Activity: Contains analysis of the human activity dataset
- 3. Neural Network Dimension Reduction: Contains dimensionality reduction for neural network analysis
- 4. Neural Network Dimension Reduction With Clusters: Contains analysis on the impact of adding clusters as features to a neural network
