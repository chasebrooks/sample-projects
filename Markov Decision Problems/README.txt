Markov Decision Processes Assignment Overview:
In this project, we seek to compare performance of model-based and model free algorithms in solving Markov Decision Problems.
Model-Based Algorithms: Value Iteration & Policy Iteration
Model-Free Algorithm: Learning


Project Requirements:
To run these notebooks you will need:
- Python3
- numpy: for data manipulation
- pandas: for data manipulation
- matplotlib: for data visualization
- MDPToolBox

How to run:
Each dataset has it's own respective jupyter notebook with the appropriate module and data imports, 
model training, and visual generation. When open, you can select Cell => Run All to run the entire 
analysis for each dataset.
The notebooks are as follows:
- 1. Forest.ipynb: contains all code to run forest management problem
- 2. Frozen Lake.ipynb: contains all code to run frozen lake problem
